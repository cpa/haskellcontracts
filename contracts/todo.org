Summarise bugs, features to add, etc. here, in addition to littering
the source with "XXX" comments.

* Bugs
** TODO multiple contracts on the same function are translated incorrectly
If

  f ::: c1

and

  f ::: c2

in the source, then the generated theory is

  T /\ ~(f:::c1) /\ ~(f:::c2)

when it should be

  T /\ ~(f:::c1&&c2),

i.e.

  T /\ (~(f:::c1) \/ ~(f:::c2)).

NB: the generated theory is unsat when either of c1 or c2 hold, which
is very wrong!

* Features
** [0/2] command line switches to control theory parameters
- [ ] whether or not 'min's are generated at all.
- [ ] placement of various "design decision" 'min's.
      - [ ] leading 'min's on arrows
      - [ ] leading 'min's on negative CFs
- [ ] what kind of definition-by-cases translation is used

      there are at least two styles

      1. [(e = BAD) \/ (\/_i exists xs_i . e = K_i xs_i) \/ (f e = UNR)]
         /\ (/\_i forall xs_i . e = K_i xs_i -> f(e) = e_i) /\ (e = BAD -> f e = BAD)

      2. (e = BAD/\ f e = BAD)
         \/ (\/_i exists xs_i . e = K_i xs_i/\ f(e) = e_i)
         \/ (e /= BAD /\ (/\_i forall xs_i . e /= K_i xs_i) /\ f e = UNR)

      and either of those can also use projectors instead of
      quantifiers.  e.g. (2) becomes

      2'. (e = BAD/\ f e = BAD)
          \/ (\/_i e = K_i (pi_1 e) ... (pi_{a_i} e)/\ f(e) = e_i)
          \/ (e /= BAD /\ (/\_i e /= K_i (pi_1 e) ... (pi_{a_i} e)) /\ f e = UNR)

      fewer quantifiers seems good, but i need to experiment to see if
      there is an improvement in practice.
- [ ] whether the 'forall a. a = ...' versions are used.
** TODO add support for 'Any' contract
the easy way to do this is to parse 'Any' to '{_:True}'
** DONE decide how to best support 'min(K(x1,...,xn)) -> min(x1) /\ ... /\ min(xn)'
update: the motivation below is still correct, but the solutions below
are dumb.  a better solution is to add

: [[K_i ::: CF^a_i -> CF]]-
: forall xs. CF(K xs) -> forall x: CF(x)

instead of the current phi_cf.  We don't have a principled argument
for the second axiom above, but the first gives K_i a contract in a
principled way, and it works because of how arrow axioms are
translated.  For example, consider Succ:

: [[Succ ::: CF^1 -> CF]]- ==> forall x. min(Succ x) -> (min(x) -> CF(x)) -> CF(Succ x)

So, we get to assume min(x) when proving CF(x), which is what we
needed for x = add_R(A',B) below.

see file:./egs/yes/add-is-cf-to-cf-to-cf.hs for an example.  The proof
gets stuck in the A = Succ(Succ_1(A)) branch where the result is
Succ(add_R(Succ_1(A),B)). The problem is that we need
min(add_R(Succ_1(A),B)) to conclude cf(add_R(Succ_1(A),B)).

The easiest solution is too add

  forall f,x. min(f x) -> min(f) /\ min(x)

But this might generate more 'min's than we'd like.  Intuitively, we
only need this propagation of 'min's into arguments for term
constructors, since the equations defining functions propagate 'min's
to the scrutinised parts already.  So, we could add

  forall x1,...,xn. min(K(x1,...,xn)) -> min(x1) /\ ... /\ min(xn)

for each term constructor 'K'.

Another, more flexible solution, could be to introduce a "deep" 'min',
s.t.

  forall x. deepmin(x) -> min(x)
  forall f,x. deepmin(f x) -> deepmin(f) /\ deepmin(x)

and then maybe

  forall x1,...,xn. min(K(x1,...,xn)) -> deepmin(K(x1,...,xn))

or maybe some other, more specific, ways to introduce 'deepmin'.
** TODO implement new phi_cf
** TODO support 'import's in example files
there is a lot of code duplication across examples.

** TODO prettier arrow contracts
it's annoying and ugly to write

  x:{x:p} -> c

so, introduce a source level translation

  {x:p} -> c ==> x:{x:p} -> c

or, maybe better to change {x:p} to x:{p}, and then

  x:x:{p} -> c ==> x:{p} -> c

This is better in the case of compound contracts, e.g.

  x:(CF&&{gt x Zero}) -> c

vs

  x:(CF&&{x:gt x Zero}) -> c

But what's the translation here?
** TODO comments on generated formulas
e.g.

  % phi_lazy <type> <constructor>
  fof(phi_lazy,axiom,...).
** TODO better classifiers on generated formulas
right now we use "axiom" for everything.  the goal formula should be a
"conjecture".  basically, we want '-' ==> 'axiom' and '+' ==>
'conjecture'.
