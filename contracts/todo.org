Summarise bugs, features to add, etc. here, in addition to littering
the source with "XXX" comments.

* Bugs
** TODO multiple contracts on the same function are translated incorrectly
If

  f ::: c1

and

  f ::: c2

in the source, then the generated theory is

  T /\ ~(f:::c1) /\ ~(f:::c2)

when it should be

  T /\ ~(f:::c1&&c2),

i.e.

  T /\ (~(f:::c1) \/ ~(f:::c2)).

NB: the generated theory is unsat when either of c1 or c2 hold, which
is very wrong!

* Features
** [0/2] command line switches to control theory parameters
- [ ] whether or not 'min's are generated at all.
- [ ] placement of various "design decision" 'min's.
